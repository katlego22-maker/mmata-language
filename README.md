# # Mmata Language (.ml)

**Mmata Language** is a groundbreaking, African-rooted programming language created by Katlego Mankga. It allows people to code using local languages such as Tswana, Sotho, Zulu, Afrikaans, and many more â€” even mixing them freely â€” while still being understood by computers.

## ðŸ”¥ Why Mmata?

Traditional programming languages mostly use English keywords, which creates a barrier for many African developers and learners. Mmata Language breaks that barrier by embracing African languages and street slang, making coding more natural, intuitive, and accessible.
