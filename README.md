# 🧠 Mmata Language (.ml)

**Mmata Language** is a groundbreaking, African-rooted programming language created by [Katlego Mankga](https://github.com/katlego22-maker).  
It lets you write code in local languages — Tswana, Sotho, Zulu, Afrikaans, slang, and more — and **have computers understand it**.

> “African-first. Human-first. Let the language speak.”

## 🔥 Why Mmata?

Most programming languages use English syntax, creating a barrier for millions.  
**Mmata breaks that barrier** by:

- Using **natural African languages** and **street slang**  
- Letting developers mix language + logic  
- Teaching computers to understand us — not the other way around

---

## 🧠 Features

- ✅ Write logic in **Tswana, Sotho, Zulu, Afrikaans**, or mix them  
- ✅ Define variables, print output, write conditions like `ge` (if), `gape` (else)
- ✅ Add your own language or slang — just edit the dictionary JSON
- ✅ Open-source, extendable, and rooted in African culture
